			<p><span class="bold">Product Name:</span> TagOn</p>
		 
			<p><span class="bold">Tagline:</span> Be a Part of the World’s Story</p>
		 
			<p><span class="bold">Group:</span> Danielle Johnson, Demitri Bannoura, Kevin Camelo</p>
		 
			<p><span class="bold">Problem:</span> In the age of social media, we became tired of sites that emphasize a strong hierarchy from post to comment to sub-comment and only showed one person’s view. Additionally, social media use has been dominated by selfies, pictures of food, and outfit of the days to exhaustion.</p>
		 
			<p><span class="bold">Solution:</span> To solve this problem, we wanted to place all reactions to the original post on the same level and make them scroll horizontally rather than vertically, which can clog feeds when there are too many comments. We also chose to bring in a global perspective by focusing stories on topics rather than people. To brand our TagOn, we targeted adventurers and welcomed unique perspectives over mundane and overdone posts.</p>
		 
			<p><span class="bold">Driving Question:</span> How can we create a social media platform that allows users all over the world to share their viewpoints and collaborate to make one unified story?</p>
			
			<p><span class="bold">Idea:</span> TagOn started as “Link,” a social media platform where users could come together and build onto each other’s posts to create their own stories. As we developed the idea, we broadened it to encompass various media forms and go beyond just stories; in addition to stories, users could debate, participate in rap battles, include pictures and videos, or take part in any activity that shares their unique view or perspective of adventure. Our aim for TagOn was to promote user engagement and interaction beyond today’s social networking norms of selfies, pictures of food, and comments nested to the point of insignificance.</p>
		 
			<h4>Branding</h4>
			<p><span class="bold">Font:</span> Metropolis Family</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Color:</span> TagOn Teal (#25AFAB)</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Logo:</span> Our logo is a hexagon, representing people of the six inhabited continents uniting to share their views and create a global story.</p>
			<p><span class="bold">Target Audience:</span> TagOn is for all people, no matter their age. We chose to target people around the world who use social media to share their adventures and photos that put their unique lives and experiences on display.</p>
		 
			<h4>Coding</h4>
			<p>TagOn was built using a basic theme in Wordpress. Beyond Wordpress customization, we had to code to modify the navigation, profile, administration settings, profile picture shapes, story formatting, and page redirects. Buddypress was our main means of user information management, and other plugins helped style our mobile navigation, modify the login page, set default avatars, and allow  users to post images and videos.</p>
