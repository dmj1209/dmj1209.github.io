			<p class="about">My name is Danielle Johnson and I'm a senior in web design as Southwest CTA in Las Vegas, NV. I was born in Knoxville, Tennessee and moved to Wichita Falls, Texas when I was 2. I lived there for 10 years before moving to Vegas in 2011.</p>

			<p class="about">At school, I am involved in SkillsUSA and National Honor Society. Outside of school, I love to volunteer at pet adoptions with Furgotten Friends Dog Rescue. I also play soccer at Sierra Vista High School. I'm a big sports fan, mostly of football and baseball. The Colts and Red Sox are my favorite teams to watch, but I also like the Celtics, Pacers, Indiana University basketball, and Penn State football.When I'm not at school or busy doing homework, volunteering, or playing soccer, I like to- oh wait I don't have free time.</p>

			<p class="about"> I have two dogs named Astro and Bauer. Astro is a 2 year old, 10 pound chihuhua and Bauer is a 7 year old, 60 pound "mountain cur." They're pretty adorable.</p>

			<p class="about">I will be attending Northwestern University in the fall to pursue journalism.</p>
