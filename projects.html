						<p class="project-p">This site was made for an English project in which each group was tasked with making a newspaper satirizing our school. Instead of making a drawing, pdf, or even a site from a template, our group decided to utilize our web design knowledge to code the site ourselves. Our goal was to make it similar to the our school's online newspaper, the Southwest Shadow. Because not everyone in the group was a web student, I coded majority of the HTML and CSS on the site. I wanted to arrange it specifically to show off the actual content of the project while being functional at the same time and mimicking a real newspaper.</p>

We were in teams of five, each person responsible for a different part- sitemap & wireframe, mockup, hosting research, HTML, and CSS. I was responsible for all CSS on the site. Our plan was to make the site look clean and modern with the big banners and circular images, but also be functional and useful for the students. Before coding, we were responsible for developing all of the content on the site, including the Inferno level descriptions, middle ages information, and other works Dante Aligheri wrote.</p>

Each member was assigned a specific task, mine being CSS. We reorganized all of the content and condensed it down to fewer pages. One member designed a mockup and one completed HTML. CSS was very important to this project because one of the main focuses was making the site responsive, meaning it resized to be compatible with tablets and mobile devices. Out goal as a group was to design a site the would be fit to be the new school site if given the opportunity.</p>

Surprisingly, free range is very difficult because you have no clue if you are going in the right direction until it's nearly done.

By using all of these tools, the goal was to make my portrait realistic, especially by using shadows.</p>

I developed that into my final logo which was my simple representation of Lake Tahoe.

I thought it would be fun to create a card using my dog as the eight reindeer and Rudolph pulling me as Santa in a sled. This card required incorporating so many elements like a border, background picture, sled, reindeer harnesses, a collar, and antlers. While I wanted to make the card fun, I also had a goal to make it look good and professional, or at least well-made.</p>

I decided to build up the snow and have a snowman build up piece by piece, starting with the snowballs, then eyes, mouth, nose, buttons, arms, and top hat.

I wanted to convey both the unique tourist town of Brian Head, but also incorporate the aspect of the art festival. I did this by recreating Brian Head's mountain and placing the arts festival going on below. I put the whole thing in a polaroid frame to represent it as a photograph of the event and kind of as a tourist attraction or postcard. I also worked very hard to place tiny details under each tent of the different types of art they might have.</p>

						<p class="project-p">For this Flash project, we were assigned in groups of two to create a shooter game. The game was based off of a Lynda course, but we replaced the graphics with our own and followed along with the coding. Our game was called "Tip a Cow" and the goal was to hit the cows with your hand. If you miss three before the time is up you lose the game. Our plan was to simulate a carnival game where the objects move around and you have to hit them to win. The cows grow bigger on the screen and the pigs move in the background to distract the player.</p>

						<p class="project-p">For this project we spent months on and off exploring a particular theme. I looked at dogs, and more specifically dog adoption. I explored various ways to present my final project including fonts, colors, and artists known for adoption art. I also ended up using both Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop. My final product was made by tracing pictures I've taken of dogs from Furgotten Friends Dog Rescue, the group I volunteer with. I chose one image to be big in the center and the rest to be in the background. For me, these dogs capture the theme of adoption because they are truly up for adoption and all need loving homes.</p>

						<p class="project-p">For the 80th anniversary of marketing education, our class was asked to create logos for client Melissa Scott. We started by researching marketing and celebration images. I started with 16 sketches and narrowed it down to three to create in Adobe Illustrator. As part of the logo creation, I developed the logo from start to finish showing my design process with changes in fonts, colors, and orientation. I also created videos explaining my logo development and design process.</p>

						<p class="project-p">For the 60th year of the Las Vegas Global Economic Alliance, our class was asked to make logos. I began by researching the Las Vegas Global Economic Alliance and trying to learn more about it. I then sketched 10 logos that I thought would represent Las Vegas, LVGEA, or both. I chose my two favorites and made composite sketches and then took them into Illustrator. My first logo has five mountains to represent the five areas of Las Vegas that LVGEA serves. I also wanted to capture the feeling of climbing a mountain and making your mark at the top. The second logo captures the "global" aspect of LVGEA and represents businesses relocating to Las Vegas with the help of LVGEA.</p>

						<p class="project-p">This logo was designed for a campaign in Environmental Science to decrease the use of palm oil, which leads to deforestation of orangutan habitats. Because of this, I placed an orangutan with a police hat and glasses to go with the "patrol" part of "Palm Oil Patrol." This logo was made in a limited amount of time, but it effectively displayed the message for our campaign.</p>

						<p class="project-p">From many broadcast journalism projects I completed in the past few years, I really enjoyed creating this senior special because it really got to the heart of who Kevin is and what his future is. This is the kind of thing I want to do in a career- something that makes other people happy and has meaning behind it. It was so fulfilling when Kevin called me afterwards to tell me how much he loved it and that I was going to be a great journalist.</p>
