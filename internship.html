				<p>Studio C had a successful year creating websites for Creating Community Impact, Never Give Up, ACTE IT, SWCTA Library, and We Create, as well as apps for Code Central and Nevada PTA. We were involved in a variety of smaller projects, including cheer posters, mission statement posters, SkillsUSA state posters, Outlook 50th episode posters, and various brochures.</p>
				<p>As head manager, I communicated with clients, delegated work among departments, ensured smooth transitions of each project between departments, and served as a quality control for final products. I was overall very proud of the job I did because I combined a work environment and professionalism with a friendly environment and personal skills. I always treated others as equals and never let my role as a head manager interfere with friendships. I was considerate of individual students’ workloads when assigning projects, and I also played a large role in communicating between departments to resolve conflicts that came in transferring work.</p>
				<p>Although we did get a bit of a slow start this year and might not have reached our full potential as a team, I am extremely proud of the transformation we made from the beginning to the end of the year. Working in Studio C was a great end to my high school career because it allowed me to apply the leadership, communication, and collaboration skills that I had learned throughout high school.</p>
